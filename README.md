# ⭐ Hospital Analytics Dashboard 

Hospitals generate large volumes of data related to patients, doctors, medicines, appointments, tests, and finance.
The raw dataset provided had duplicates, missing values, inconsistent formatting, and no clear structure, making it difficult to generate meaningful insights or build a professional dashboard.

The goal was to convert this scattered dataset into a fully functional Hospital Analytics System using Excel, SQL, and Power BI.

## had to:

 - 1 **Clean, prepare, and structure the data** for easy reporting

 - 2 Build a **Star Schema data model** for accurate relationships

 - 3 Create **DAX measures and calculated tables**

 - 4 Design **five interactive dashboards** (Overview, Patient, Doctor, Hospital, Finance)

 - 5 Generate **business insights** based on patient behavior, medicine sales, financials, and hospital operations

 The project needed to be end-to-end, reliable, and dashboards should be visually appealing and business-ready.

## 🧹 Excel — Data Preparation

 - Cleaned all raw datasets

 - Removed duplicates and fixed missing/null values

 - Standardized formats for dates, IDs, and categories

 - Ensured all files were ready for SQL and Power BI ingestion

## 🛢 SQL — Data Structuring

 - Created Views for simplified reporting

 - Used LEFT JOINs to merge relational tables

 - Prepared reusable datasets for Power BI

 - Ensured proper primary–foreign key alignment

## 📐 Power BI — Data Modeling & Dashboarding
**1. Built a complete Star Schema**

  - Fact tables: Bills, Tests, Surgeries, Medicine Sales, Patients, Appointments

  - Dimension tables: Date, Department, Doctor, Patient, Parameter Tables

  - Created clean one-to-many relationships

**2. Created Advanced DAX Measures**

 Examples include:

  - Total_bill_amount

  - Total_med_sale_qty

  - Doctor_commission_amt

  - Doctor_commission_rate

  - Patient_count

  - Admitted_status

 - Discharged_per

  - Satisfaction_rating

  - Total_stock_QTY

  - More custom icons, calculated rating, parameters, and KPI measures

**3. Built 5 fully interactive Dashboards**

**📌 Overview Dashboard**
**📌 Patient Dashboard**
**📌 Doctor Dashboard**
**📌 Hospital Dashboard**
**📌 Finance Dashboard**

Each containing dynamic visualizations, KPIs, slicers, and advanced charts.
